// when fetching a card from the db, maybe check if setname is being usedm if not just use that name to search the Card collection
// if setname is being query the actual CardCollection to check for the cards specific name
    // then check each card inside and see if the set matches
    // if you find a match return that card info
    // if no match just return the first card in the array itself.
